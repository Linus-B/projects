We choose an element towards the middle to be the pivot to limit the chance of a worst case run time.
Then we find what order that number is within the array.
Once done, we know if the item is to the left or right of it.
Chance our bounds, and check our new part of the array. 
Repeat until whatever pivot we chose happens to be the ith element we wanted
