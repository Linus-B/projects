I created a heap of size 500, so the most amount of things you can add is 500. It's a simple heap implementation without too many complexities. I didn't write many comments because nothing I did was too crazy. Let me know if I need to do more though, and I can write more on future programming assignments. 

For the Insertion, I have it add to the bottom then bubble up

For the deletion, I have it move the bottom to the top then bubble down

This problem was pretty easy, I'm not sure what else to say. 

This program actually doesn't run on my computer, I get an "Illegal Instruction: 4" which seems to be a Mac issue. It works fine when I remote into apollo.cselabs and run it there.
