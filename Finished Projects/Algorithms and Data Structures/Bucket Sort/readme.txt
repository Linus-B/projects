My comments are actually quite clear on this one, so I'm kinda copying off those.

Step 1: Create all the buckets

Step 2: Insert from the array into those buckets

Step 3/4: If a bucket is too large, call bucketsort, otherwise sort it 

Step 5: Re-copy everything from the buckets back into the original array

Then output everything

I used Insertion Sort as the sorting method within bucket sort because it's easy to code

Et voila, that's the entirety of bucket sort.
