**Welcome to my Repo!**

This is a collection of some preojects from school, and lots of personal projects. Unfortunately the Jupyter-Lab overtakes everything else for language usage, which is actually all in R, but overall I think the language I program the most in are Java and Python. I participate in programming competitions, so I have folders filled with those code segments on my PC, but it was coded wtih speed in mind. Therefore it was uncommented, and I deemed it unsuitable for this repository.

The Discontinued Projects folder contains projects which I started, but had to stop for various reasons, primarily because of disinterest of the person I was making it for. But still I completed enough to show.

The Current Projects has some larger projects that are still in development. Unsure when this rpeo will be updated, but I'll still be working on it on my own device and git. 

The completed projects folder is where most of my work is. 
  * Machine Learning contains reminders for different machine learning methods
  * Small Projects has single files that were very fast, and just answering a simple question
  * Every other folder is runnable code.

**Projects to Mention**
  * Boggle
    * This project uses a Trie to find every possible word on a boggle board of arbitrary length. I will continue this project by using picture recognition to be able to receive a picture of the board instead of inputting it manually. That is in the current projects folder
  * SecretSwapper
    * Fully functional IPhone app that took a lot of effort, and turned out very well.
  * guessingGame
    * First time creating a web server. Using this information to make better websites, which will be in current projects.
